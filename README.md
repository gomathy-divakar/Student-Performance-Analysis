# Student-Performance-Analysis
This data is student final grade in secondary education of two schools.Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (maths) and Portuguese language (portuguese).  I have classified these students into three categories, "good", "fair", and "poor", according to their final exam performance. Then I analyzed a few features that have significant influence on students' final performance, including Romantic Status, Alcohol Consumption, Parents Education Level, Frequency Of Going Out, Desire Of Higher Education and Living Area. Finally, leveraging avaiable features, I have created various machine learning models to predict students' final performance classification and have compared models performance based on one-out sample accuracy score.

Conclusion: The Student whos performance are good are likely to have this profile:
not in a romantic relationship, 
does not consume alcohol, 
living in an urban area, 
does not go out with friends frequently, 
have stronger desire to go to higher education,
parents both received higher education.
